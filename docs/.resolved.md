## Issue: React Compiler `useMemoCache` Runtime Error

**Date:** 2026-01-06  
**Status:** ⚠️ PENDING (requires browser cache clear)  
**Severity:** Critical - Blocks BassTrainer component rendering

---

### 🐛 Problem

When navigating to the exercise view (BassTrainer), the application crashes with:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useMemoCache')
    at BassTrainer (http://localhost:5173/src/BassTrainer.jsx:25:3)
```

### 🔍 Root Cause

1. The project had `babel-plugin-react-compiler` enabled in `vite.config.js`
2. This compiler transforms React code to use internal optimization hooks like `useMemoCache`
3. The compiled code was cached in the browser
4. After disabling the compiler, the browser still serves the old compiled code

### ✅ Solution Applied

**File:** `vite.config.js`

```diff
  plugins: [
-   react({
-     babel: {
-       plugins: [['babel-plugin-react-compiler']],
-     },
-   }),
+   react(),
    tailwindcss(),
```

### 🧹 User Action Required

To fully resolve, users must clear their browser cache:

1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Clear Site Data** (or use Storage → Clear)
4. Alternatively, use **Incognito/Private** mode
5. Reload the page

### 📋 Related Changes

This issue was discovered while implementing:
- `ProgressBar.jsx` - New progress indicator component
- Practice Night Mode - High contrast theme for low-light practice
- 3-way theme selector (Dark / Light / Practice)
- Auto-scroll tablature to active note

### 🔮 Future Considerations

If React Compiler is to be re-enabled:
1. Ensure React version is compatible (React 19+)
2. Configure proper runtime support
3. Test thoroughly before deployment
4. Consider adding a cache-busting mechanism
